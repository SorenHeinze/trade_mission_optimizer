ATTENTION: 
- USE TABS TO SEPARATE INFORMATION!
- Order needs to be < STATION NAME >, < SYSTEM NAME>, < COMMODITY NAME >, < QUANTITY > but with TABS instead of commas.
- The "commodity" of a delivery mission is always "Delivery". It doesn't matter what you haul.
- All names (stations, systems, commodities) need to be as they are in game.
- It is OK to leave "empty" entries as long as the number of tabs is NOT 4!
- Below I have some examples to guide you. DELETE THESE!



< START LOCATION > --- DON'T DELETE THE TAB AFTER "at"!

I'm at	Colonia Dream	Ratraii



< Missions START > --- DON'T DELETE THIS LINE! THE PROGRAM WILL STOP WORKING IF YOU DO!

This is an example for two source and return missions.
Jaques Station	Colonia	Fish	23
Jaques Station	Colonia	Gallium	42

This is an example for empty entries to be used later. Observe that the number of tabs is just two!
Giles Station	Deriso	
Giles Station	Deriso	

This is an example for three delivery missions. It doesn't matter what I need to deliver.
Whirling Station	Ogmar	Delivery	25
Whirling Station	Ogmar	Delivery	45
Whirling Station	Ogmar	Delivery	2

This is an example for all of the above.
